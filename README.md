# GPU Accelerated Particles

This is a project I am working on in my spare time. Mainly for fun, research and mastering OpenGL ES 2.0. Eventually, this will become a particle system simulated and render entirely on GLSL shaders.

TODO:

1. Add a velocities buffer and duplicate positions and velocities buffers.
2. Compute positions and velocities in fragment shaders.
3. Introduce buffer swapping mechanism
