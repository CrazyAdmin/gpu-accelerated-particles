# GPU Accelerated Particles

This is a project I am working on in my spare time. Mainly for fun, research and mastering OpenGL ES 2.0. This is a particle system simulated and rendered entirely on GPU.

TODO:

1. Add velocity buffer.
2. Introduce gravity concept.
3. Add mouse position bound gravity.
4. Add timer.
5. Add fixed simulation step support.
