# GPU Accelerated Particles

This is a project I am working on in my spare time. Mainly for fun, research and mastering OpenGL ES 2.0. This is a particle system simulated and rendered entirely on GPU.

This demo uses experimental WebGL features such as floating point textures and rendering to multiple frame buffers. May not work on most browsers. Firefox and a decent GPU should do fine.
